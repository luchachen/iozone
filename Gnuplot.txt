The script gen_graphs will create the 3D surface plots
and display them.  It will also produce postscript outputs
for each test and leave them in their respective sub-directory.

It processes the output from an Iozone run. The output from
Iozone that it is expecting is the text output from
the iozone default behavior. (iozone -a, or iozone -az)

How to produce graphs:

   gen_graphs iozone.out

The gen_graphs script will:
1. Create the databases for each type of operation 
   and then processes them with Gnuplot.
2. It will display each result on the X11 screen, and
   also save a copy in postscript in the test sub-directory.
